# CompactEffects11
Compact Effects11 by sygh.

This is a library forked from the sample "Effects11" in the legacy DirectX SDK (June 2010).
Currently the *original* and *official* Effects11 has been hosted and maintained as [FX11](https://github.com/Microsoft/FX11) by Microsoft, but Compact Effects11 can remove the dependency on the runtime "D3DCompiler_xx.dll" with some limitations.
